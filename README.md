A cheap and simple home automation system was designed with NodeMCU(programmed in Arduino)

In a nutshell all the project does is that it provides users the ability to turn off electrical equipments (AC loads) using an android
app named Bylink and displays real time data of how many persons are present in a room. Based on number of persons present in a room
the system is also capable of turning on/off certain electrical equipments as wished.
